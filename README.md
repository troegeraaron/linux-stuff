# linux-stuff
Random linux and development resources

This is mainly for my dumbass because I forget everything and I want / need these settings for multiple computers (and just for tinkering around!)

I can put resources for learning stuff here as well, I guess as kind of a bookmark system, only if I really need it, otherwise normal bookmarks in the
browser work fine. But again, keeping my resources synced between computers has proven a pain. Some systems work, others make it too difficult. Github
I can just use a repository on each computer. Simple enough.
